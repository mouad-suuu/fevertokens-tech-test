To find your friend's broken-down car on an infinite highway, start by driving a set distance \( d \) in one direction (e.g., east), then return to your starting point and drive the same distance \( d \) in the opposite direction (west). If you haven't found your friend, double the search distance to \( 2d \), drive east for \( 2d \), return to the starting point, and then drive west for \( 2d \). Continue this process, doubling the search distance each time (i.e., \( d, 2d, 4d, 8d, \ldots \)) until you locate your friend's car. This method ensures you systematically cover both directions, guaranteeing that you will find your friend's car in a finite amount of time.
